**Questions for fellow playtesters:**
Your invaluable feedback is well appreciated :) 

1. How long did it take you to reach the purple ticket booth? (Answer given by the timer top right. Timer stops and turns purple when ticket booth has been touched by the player)
2. On a scale of 1 to 10 how hard do you find the obstacles to be?
3. Could you rank the obstacles (coins challenge) in order in terms of difficulty with 1 being easiest and 5 being hardest?
4. Are there any bugs/glitches that you came accross (i.e immobolized between object, stuck inside the tunnel with no way to get back on track,...)? 
5. What component do you wish should have been implemented/altered to improve the experience? 
6. What was your initial reaction to this game?
7. Optional: Any other note you would like to tell me?
